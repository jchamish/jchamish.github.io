### Education
I graduated from Binghamton University in 2014 with a concentration in Computer Engineering(COE). Then decided to get my masters in Computer Science(CS) because I wanted to cover the whole scope of software and hardware. I was part of the Binghamton Wreslting team for 3 years where I wreslted Division 1.
